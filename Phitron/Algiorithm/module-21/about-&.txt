The runtime error you're encountering when omitting the reference (&) in the top_down function is likely related to inefficient memory usage or stack overflow due to excessive copying of the height vector.

Here's why:

1. Argument Passing Without Reference (&)
When you pass the height vector by value, a copy of the entire vector is created for each recursive call to top_down. If n is large, this results in:

    Significant memory overhead because every recursive call involves duplicating the vector.
    Stack overflow due to excessive recursion depth and large copies being placed on the call stack.
2. Argument Passing With Reference (&)
When you pass the height vector by reference (e.g., vector<int>& height), no copying occurs. Instead, the function operates on the original vector, avoiding unnecessary memory usage and reducing the load on the call stack.

3. Why Is It an Issue Despite Not Modifying height?
Even if you are not modifying the height vector, passing it by value leads to:

    Extra time spent copying the vector.
    Increased memory usage with every recursive call.
    A higher likelihood of stack overflow for large input sizes due to deeper recursion and larger stack frames.
